# Advertising_Efficacy-matplotlib-pandas-seaborn-
#You work in the advertising department of an expensive car dealership and are currently trying to analyze the effectiveness of different advertisements. You currently have ads on T.V, on the radio, and in the newspaper. You're given a dataset that records how much money you spent in each type of advertising (in thousands of dollars) and the number of sales that were recorded for that period (in tens of thousands of dollars). Analyze the data to determine which medium has the greatest effect on sales.

Start by reading in the data into a DataFrame. Then display a histogram of cost for each type of advertising. Which medium does the company spend the most money on currently?
